# Systima-QA-test-task

Used Axios for API testing because 
- It is easy to use
- Well documented
- Has a large community of developers who use it
- Can handle a wide range of HTTP requests
- Provides features as request / response interception, automatic transformation of JSON and support for auth

For functional testing I used Cypress because
- It provides an intuitive and easy-to-use API for writing test cases
- Can handle a wide range of technologies and frameworks
- Provides useful features such as automatic waiting, real-time reloading and easy debugging
